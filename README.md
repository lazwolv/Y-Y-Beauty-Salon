# Y-Y-Beauty-Salon

This is my first full blown project.

It is a beauty salon website. It has been in the making for a while and I am very proud of it.

There are a ton of features that I have in mind to add to it.

I am using it as a way to learn more about React and I am also using it to learn more about Node.js. It has been a great "learn by doing" experience.

I plan to fully finish it and deploy it to a server. I will also be adding more features to it as I learn more about React and CSS. Once it is being used by real people, I will be able to improve it based on real feedback.
